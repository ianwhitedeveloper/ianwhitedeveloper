# Hi, I'm Ian White 👋

I’m a Senior Staff Software Engineer with 10+ years of experience increasing engineering leverage through **platform tooling**, **frontend systems**, and **scalable JavaScript architectures**. I specialize in **full-stack JavaScript**, **UI/Frontend engineering**, **platform engineering**, and **Node.js**. I care deeply about **continuous learning**, **mentorship**, and building thoughtful systems with great people.

## 📌 Featured Work

The most meaningful impact of my work comes from **improving the systems around the code** — enabling teams to build, test, and ship high-quality software more effectively over time.

### 🧭 Staff-Level Contributions (ZenBusiness, Vrbo, and Beyond)

Across both high-growth product teams and large, mature platforms, I’ve worked at the intersection of **product delivery**, **platform evolution**, and **engineering culture**.

- Designed and influenced **shared frontend and backend systems** used across multiple teams via UI/library frameworks and micro frontend (MFE) accelerators
- Helped guide **JavaScript and Node.js architectural direction** with a focus on clarity, testability, and long-term maintainability
- Invested in **developer experience as a force multiplier**, treating internal tooling and workflows as products
- Acted as a **technical multiplier** through mentorship, design reviews, technical documentation, tech talks, and cross-team collaboration
- Balanced short-term delivery with **strategic technical investments** that compound team velocity over time

This work includes experience in:
- **Fast-scaling product environments** (ZenBusiness), where growing teams and systems quickly was critical
- **Global platforms at scale** (Vrbo / Expedia Group), where reliability, ownership boundaries, and incremental evolution mattered most

## 🧠 How I Think About Engineering

Some principles that consistently guide my work:

- **Leverage over output** — improve the system so everyone ships better software
- **Developer experience is a product** — friction compounds, in both directions
- **Simple solutions over clever code** - and provide abstractions only as necessary
- **Testing enables speed** — strong feedback loops unlock confidence
- **People are the system** — mentorship, trust, and shared understanding matter
- **Choose the right tool for the job** - There is nothing inherintly wrong with monoliths or microservices, only the misapplication thereof

---

## 🔥 Things I Believe Strongly About

- Velocity without direction is just motion
- Testing is a design tool, not a tax
- Consistency (usually) beats novelty at scale, but not at the sake of rigidity - I try to consider as many approaches as possible
- The best codebases teach
- Small DevEx improvements compound into outsized gains

## 🤖 AI-Driven Development (AIDD) & Parallel Drive

I’m currently working with **[Parallel Drive](https://paralleldrive.com/)** exploring how **AI-Driven Development (AIDD)** can fundamentally improve how software is designed, built, and evolved.

My interest in AIDD is a natural extension of my long-standing focus on:

- Scaling **human judgment**, not just code
- Reducing **cognitive load** and shortening feedback loops
- Using AI to **augment engineers**, not obscure understanding
- Making high-quality practices easier to sustain over time

I’m particularly interested in how AIDD can improve:
- Architectural exploration and decision-making
- Onboarding and shared system understanding
- Long-term maintainability of complex systems

## 🧑‍🏫 Consulting, Advisory, & Staff+ IC Work

I’m well-suited for roles and engagements focused on **increasing engineering leverage** in addition to shipping quality features.

I can help teams with:

- High quality application and system development
- Platform and **DevEx strategy**
- Scaling **React and Node.js** architectures
- Staff+ IC collaboration and technical guidance
- Mentorship and technical leadership
- Pragmatic modernization of existing systems

If you’re working on problems where **clarity, leverage, and long-term thinking** matter, we’ll likely get along well.
